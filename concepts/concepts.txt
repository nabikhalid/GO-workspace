Go is a compiled language 
Go is built of C/C++
No vitrual machines
Minimalistic language, easier to learn 

Go is very fast, almost as fast as C, but you get memory management built into the runtime.
Go has arrays and maps ( dictionaries ) built into the language so you can focus on building better algorithms.
Go comes with a great standard library with high level building blocks such as a web server.  This allows you to focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.
Go is opinionated, so you can get to work using choices the language creators made rather than spinning your wheels thinking about other things.
Go promises backwards compatibility in version 1.x so upgrading your version of go will not break your code, this is a game changer for use in enterprise.
